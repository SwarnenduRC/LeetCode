# LeetCode

Solutions to various Leetcode's problems

## Description

It is a repo of various problems in Leetcode in modern C++-17.

## C++ Build

To build the application simply make which will build two
binaries under the bin folder for Debug & Release. To clean
it run `make clean`. To build only debug/release run `make debug`
or `make release`.

## Python Build

Python is an interpreted language and nothing to be built as such

## C++ Tests

The console application itself is a Google test application that is used to test
the various data structure classes and their methods. So you need to have a Google
test framework installed and active or available on your build machine to successfully
run this application. 

If you don't have `GoogleTest framework` available you can run the `GoogleTest.sh`
script to download and install the GoogleTest framework on your Mac machine
(the script is made for MacOS Ventura on an M2 machine but can be easily modified
for any other OS and configuration)

## Memory Leaks - C++

The console application has been tested for memory leaks using `leaks` tool on MacOS Ventura
and none found. 
You can ru it by using `leaks --atExit --list -- ./bin/LeetCodeD --gtest_shuffle --gtest_repeat=3`

## Python Tests

The python solutions are tested by `pytest` framework and can be simply run by
`python3 -m pytest` on a MacOS/Linux based sytem
